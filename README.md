Project Description:

The "Healthcare Analytics for Doctors' Visits" project aims to analyze and gain insights from healthcare data to understand patterns related to illness, healthcare access, and socio-demographic factors. Using this dataset, the project explores various metrics such as illness frequency, income levels, insurance coverage, and healthcare access to help healthcare providers, policymakers, and analysts make informed decisions. The primary goal is to evaluate how factors like income, gender, and insurance status affect healthcare utilization and outcomes, ultimately aiming to improve resource allocation and patient support programs.

Result:

The healthcare dataset analysis uncovered several key insights. Duplicate records were removed for quality assurance, and we found higher illness rates among low-income individuals and the elderly, with females experiencing more reduced activity days due to illness than males. Income disparities were evident, with lower-income individuals relying more on government insurance and visiting hospitals more frequently, showing their greater dependency on healthcare services. Correlation analysis revealed links between income, insurance status, and healthcare access, while lower private insurance uptake indicated coverage gaps. Overall, these findings highlight areas for targeted healthcare support and resource allocation, addressing the specific needs of at-risk groups based on gender, income, and insurance.
